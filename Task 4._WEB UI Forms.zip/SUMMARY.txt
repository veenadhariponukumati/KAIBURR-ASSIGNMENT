IN THIS TASK, I HAVE CREATED A WEB PAGE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO MY COLLEGE WEBSITE (VIT UNIVERSITY, CHENNAI).

IN THE WEBSITE.ZIP, WEB PAGE IS THE MAIN PAGE YOU CAN CLICK AND OPEN. FROM THEN REMAINING ALL ARE THE LIST OF SCHOOLS.

WHEN YOU SCROLL DOWN IN THE WEB PAGE, YOU WILL SEE A LIST OF SCHOOLS WHICH MEANS DIFFERENT BRANCHES IN OUR WORDS.

THEN YOU CAN GO AND ACCESS WHAT TYPE OF SUBJECTS ARE THEIR IN EACH BRANCH WHEN YOU CLICK ON EACH SCHOOL WHICH WILL BE OPENED IN A NEW WINDOW.

THE UPLOADED DOCUMENTS ARE BOTH SAME BUT IN DIFFERENT FORMAT.

YOU CAN ACCESS THE CODE FOR EACH SCHOOL FROM THEM.
